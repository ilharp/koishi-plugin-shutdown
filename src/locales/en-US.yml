  shutdown:
    description: Power off or reboot Koishi
    usage: |-
      shutdown may be used to power off or reboot Koishi.
      The first argument may be a time string (which is usually "now"). Optionally, this may be followed by a wall message to be sent to all logged-in users before going down.
      The time string may either be in the format "hh:mm" for hour/minutes specifying the time to execute the shutdown at, specified in 24h clock format. Alternatively it may be in the syntax "+m" referring to the specified number of minutes m from now. "now" is an alias for "+0", i.e. for triggering an immediate shutdown. If no time argument is specified, "+1" is implied.
      Note that to specify a wall message you must specify a time argument, too.
      If the time argument is used, 5 minutes before the system goes down the /run/nologin file is created to ensure that further logins shall not be allowed.

    options:
      reboot: Reboot Koishi.
      k: Do not power off or reboot, but just write the wall message.
      no-wall: Do not send wall message before power off or reboot.
      c: Cancel a pending shutdown. This may be used to cancel the effect of an invocation of shutdown with a time argument that is not "+0" or "now".
      show: Show a pending shutdown action and time if there is any.

    messages:
      no-pending: There's no pending shutdown.
